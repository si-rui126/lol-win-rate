# lol-win-rate
I was always curious about how win probability is calculated live on the overlay during pro matches, so I wanted to try it out for myself. I'm using data with a sample size of around 10k ranked games in high Diamond to Masters elo, provided by Kaggle user Yi Lan Ma.

The data is pretty old in terms of the game, as it was posted 4 years ago. I'm curious if the meta has changed so much since then that a model trained on this data would result in a lot of error if tested on data from current games.
